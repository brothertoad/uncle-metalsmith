	My second completion for this month is the Hasegawa Spitfire Mk. IXc, kit 09079/Jt79.  It was built
	out of the box.  I botched a couple of things and had to borrow pieces for a second copy of the same
	kit (in the Revell of Germany boxing).

	I used my Tamiya mix for the cockpit.  I primed with
	Ace Gray Primer from a spray can.  I then did something I don't think I've ever done before - I
	wet-sanded the primer with 2500 sandpaper.  That did seem to smooth the surface, although
	next time I will start with 1500, then use 2000 and 2500.  The camouflage
	was all Model Master Enamel, Medium Sea Gray for the bottom and Ocean Gray and RAF Dark Green on
	top.  The fuselage band and spinner with also Model Master Enamel, namely Sky.
	All of these went on a little rough, as all my paint jobs do.

	The landing gear is a mix of colors, which was unintentional.  I had painted all the gear and the wheels
	with CreateFX Silver, which is quite bright.  I then realized that I had forgotten to attach the oleo
	scissors to the landing gear, so I used the gear from the Revell boxing.  I painted them with a different
	paint, but I can't remember which it was.  It may have been Model Master Metalizer Aluminum.  The tires
	were Mr. Color 137 Tire Black.  The main tires were airbrushed, as they are separate pieces from the covers.
	I hand painted the tail tire, after thinning the paint a bit with Tamiya Lacquer Thinner.  It was only a
	small area, but it went on very well.

	The decals are from the kit.  I did the insignia on the wing bottoms with Mr. Setter, which has been
	recommended for decals from Japanese manufacturers.  However, I did the rest with MicroSet, which worked
	well.  I did need to apply various softeners several times on some of the decals.

	The canopy did not fit well.  I forgot to test fit before painting.  Also, there is supposed to be a
	rear view mirror on top of the windscreen.  I went to attach it, but found there is no mounting hole.
	If/when I built this kit again, I will drill a tiny hole for the mirror.  Also, the canopy frame is darker
	than the corresponding color on the main airframe.  This happens a lot with me, and I'm not sure why.
