<p>
	As with my {{ mymacros.linkTo('previous build', "0901/") }}, this is my third build of this kit.  I had
	started the Airfix 109 (kit A05122), and found it didn't go together very well, so I decided to build
	this kit and use the decals from the Airfix kit.
</p>
<p>
	The cockpit was painted with my Tamiya mix for {{ mymacros.rlm('02') }}.  It turned out very well, probably the
	best cockpit I've done so far.  I was so proud of it that I had a friend who is an accomplished
	photographer (and who has a macrolens) take some photos of it, one of which is at the bottom of
	this page.  Unfortunately, the rest of the kit did not turn out as well.
</p>
<p>
	I can't remember what I primed with - it may have been Model Master Enamel Primer, as I was
	painting this and {{ mymacros.linkTo('the Hasegawa P-51D', "1002/") }} at the same time.  The {{ mymacros.rlm('04') }} (yellow)
	and {{ mymacros.rlm('65') }} (light blue) were Model Master Enamel.  They went on fine.  I had read on
	{{ mymacros.linkTo('Hyperscale', "http://www.hyperscale.com") }} that Floquil Pullman Green, which I had a bottle
	of, was a good match for {{ mymacros.rlm('71') }}, so I used that.  It went on terribly, like sandpaper, and was
	quite glossy (which I don't like).
</p>
<p>
	The prop also gave me grief.  I painted the prop blades with Tamiya XF-27 Black Green, which never
	seems to stick to plastic.  In addition, after masking it and spraying silver to represent the
	center of the prop, I broke one of the blades trying to remove the masking.  I order an Ultracase
	48128 Propellor and Spinner from {{ mymacros.linkTo('Sprue Brothers', "http://www.spruebrothers.com") }} to
	replace it, and a jar of Mr. Color 18 {{ mymacros.rlm('70') }} Black Green to use on it.  This turned out much better.
</p>
<p>
	I gloss coated with Future, cut with a homebrew reducer consisting of 91% isopropyl alcohol with
	a bit of Liquitex flo-aid added.  A fellow at a local model club recommended this as a thinner
	for Tamiya paints.  I also used a siphon feed airbrush (Badger Anthem) rather than my
	usual gravity feed (Iwata Eclipse).  It went on pretty well, given the incredibly rough undersurface.
	As mentioned above, the decals are
	from an Airfix kit.  I wanted a Romanian plane in my collection.
	They worked okay with Microset.  They probably would have worked better with a smoother surface
	under them!
</p>
<p>
	Lessons for a future build: Future with alcohol/flo-aid mixture from a siphon feed airbrush.
	Fit the canopy before painting.  Attach the antenna mast before attaching the rear canopy
	section.  When attaching the canopy, attach the middle section first, to make sure that the
	hinges align with the fuselage.

	I had {{ mymacros.linkTo('a friend who is a great photographer', 'https://www.facebook.com/Nadim-Baki-Photography-726158177438522/' ) }}
	to take this photo of the
	cockpit, since it is the best one I've done so far.  I especially like
	how the instrument panel came out.  Unfortunately, it went straight
	downhill from there.
