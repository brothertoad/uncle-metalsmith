    I was perusing my considerable stash, trying to decide which kit to start next,
    and this one kind of jumped out at me.  Like most Japanese aircraft, it has
    a relatively simple paint scheme, so I figured it would be reasonably quick.

    Per {{ 'this discussion' | linkTo('http://www.network54.com/Forum/149674/thread/1267495108/Ki-100+interior+color+question') | safe }}
    on the {{ 'Hyperscale forums' | linkTo('http://www.clubhyper.com/forums/forum.htm') | safe }},
    the cockpit floor was supposed to be a greyish purple, which reminded me of {{'75'|rlm|safe}}.
    I used Tamiya {{'82'|txf|safe}} Ocean Gray.  I used {{'13'|txf|safe}} JA Green for the rest of the
    cockpit.  The same discussion said the radio panel should be greyish khaki.
    The color sample reminded me of Tamiya {{'51'|txf|safe}} Khaki Drab, but I figured
    the difference in color would not be visible, so I left it in the same color
    as the rest of the cockpit wall.

    The underside was painted Alclad II Aluminum, with the control surfaces being
    Tamiya {{'14'|txf|safe}} JA Gray.  The top was {{'13'|txf|safe}} JA Green, the same as the cockpit.
    The propellor and spinner were {{'131'|mrcolor|safe}} Propellor Color, and the
    yellow on the leading edges of the wings and the tips of the propellor
    blades was {{'58'|mrcolor|safe}} Orange Yellow.  I used Tamiya
    {{'16'|txf|safe}} Flat Aluminum for the landing gear and wheels.  This color is rather
    grainy, but it is not particularly noticeable on small parts.  The tires were
    painted Tamiya {{'69'|txf|safe}} NATO Black.  This is the first time I've used that color,
    and I thought it looked just right.

    As with the {{ 'Bf 109K-4' | linkTo('../0101/') | safe }}, I decided to try a different
    pre-decal gloss coat.  This time I used Model Master Metalizer Sealer.  I
    put two coats on the top, but it still didn't look that glossy.  I didn't bother
    to put it on the bottom, since the Alclad looked glossy enough.  I had a lot
    of silvering.  To try to fix this, I applied a lot of decal solvent, which left
    a lot of white residue.  The decals came from the kit, and otherwise worked
    well.

    The canopy was masked using
    {{ 'Montex Maxi Mask MM48149' | linkTo('http://www.montex-mask.com/en/oferta') | safe }}.
    This was the first time
    I used one of their products, and the canopy mask fit perfectly - much better
    than any Eduard or EZ-Mask I've ever used.  The mask set actually came with
    masks for all the outside markings except the stencils, but I was not brave
    enough to try them.
