    Here is the Hasegawa 1/72 P-47D Razorback, kit 507. I started this kit after
    I was frustrated with other kits I was working on, and I wanted something that
    I could complete relatively quickly. I also wanted to try Gaia EVO Surfacer as
    a primer, and thought this simple kit would do nicely.
</p>
<p>
    The kit went together well.  The cockpit - which is devoid of any detail
    except a seat - was painted Tamiya XF-70 IJN Green 2.  I read that this was a
    close match for FS34092 Euro Dark Green, which is something close to the dull
    dark green that was used.  It was actually too dark, although the hue was not
    too far off to my eye.
</p>

    I primed with Gaia Surfacer EVO Silver GS-06.  I had picked this up somwhere
    along the line and wanted to try it, since silver makes a good primer (it is
    very easy to cover with just about any color).  I used Tamiya XF-3 Flat
    Yellow for the cowling and the propellor tips.  After masking the cowling,
    I sprayed Tamiya XF-16 Flat Aluminum over the yellow overspray, since I was
    afraid it might show through and I didn't want to spray a lacquer over
    the Tamiya acrylic.  The underside was painted Tamiya XF-53
    Neutral Gray and the top was Tamiya XF-51 Khaki Drab.  I prefer this over
    Tamiya Olive Drab, as I think the Olive Drab is too dark.  As I was painting
    the model, I was not pleased with the paint job, but in the end it turned
    out okay, except I realized after I was done that the gray should have
    extended up to underneath the rear stabilizers.

    The landing gear, wheels, and propellor hub were painted Gaia EX-07, thinned
    with automotive lacquer thinner.  I have used this for large areas and found
    it a little grainy, but on small areas it works well.  The propellor blades
    and the tires were hand painted with Model Color Black.

    The drop tanks were
    primed with Ace Hardware Gray Primer from a rattle can, followed by Mr. Color
    C-159 Super Silver.  That did not look good, so I added a coat of Tamiya
    XF-16 Flat Aluminum.  That was grainy, as it usually is, but better than
    the Super Silver.

    I used the Eduard CX083 mask set for the canopy.  It fit very well,
    although I scrunched a couple of edges so there is a little overspray.

    The decals came from
    {{ mymacros.linkTo('Techmod 72105', 'http://www.techmod.pl/aviation-72/72105-republic-p-47d-thunderbolt') }}.
    I put the first one in warm water for about twenty five seconds, at which
    point it came off the paper and floated in the water!  For the remaining
    decals, I put it in warm water for about 10-12 seconds, and they worked
    very well.  I used Microsol with most, but at the end I tried Mr. Hobby
    Setter, and that worked well too.
