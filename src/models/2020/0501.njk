<p>
    This is the second attempt at building this kit.  The reputation it has for
    being a difficult kit to build is fully deserved.  I cannot honestly say that I
    enjoyed this build - it was a chore.
</p>
<p>
    Assembling the cockpit and getting the fuselage halves together was a pain.
    From reading {{ "Tom Cleaver's build" | linkTo('http://www.modelingmadness.com/review/allies/cleaver/gb/spit/tc9e.htm') | safe }}
    on Modeling Madness, I knew that the fit was very precise, so I was careful to
    sand off all debris from the sprue attachment points.  I still had difficulty
    getting the fuselage to close up.  I did attach the sidewalls to the fuselage
    halves before attaching the various parts, which helped a little.

    The external colors are Tamiya, {{'83'|txf|safe}} Medium Sea Gray 2 (RAF) on the bottom,
    and {{'82'|txf|safe}} Ocean Gray 2 (RAF) and {{'81'|txf|safe}} Dark Green 2 (RAF) on the top.
    As with my last few RAF builds, the camouflage was freehanded.

    The decals came from the kit.  They went on rather easily with Microset, but
    when I was attaching the last few parts after decaling, the black rectangle
    on the rear of the port wing came off.  Also, as I was attaching the parts,
    I learned that it would have been much easier to attach the tail wheel before
    assembling the fuselage halves.

    I have several Eduard Spitfires in the stash.  The only other kits of these marks
    that are reasonably available are the Hasegawa ones, and I have trouble with those
    as well.  That said, it will probably be a while before I start another Eduard.
