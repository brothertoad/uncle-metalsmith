<p>
    This build was the result of yet another sequence of failed builds.  I was getting
    frustrated, so I chose something simple.

<p>
    I had had some trouble with the {{ 'Sherman from this series' | linkTo('../2019/0201/') | safe }},
    but this kit went together well.  I primed with {{'Mr. Surfacer'|nowrap|safe}} 1000, and used my
    Tamiya mix for U.S. Armor (3 parts {{ '62'|txf|safe }} to 1 part {{ '60'|txf|safe }}).  The
    pre-decal gloss coat was Right Step Gloss, and the post-decal flat coat was
    my Future / Tamiya Flat Base mix (about 5 parts Future to 1 part Flat Base).
