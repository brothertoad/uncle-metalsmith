    This is the Academy 1/72 Messerschmitt Bf109G-14, kit 1653, with
    EagleCals 72-43 decals.
</p>
<p>
    According to the EagleCal documentation, this represents an aircraft from 4./JG 77
    in Schonwalde, Germany, in November 1944. The {{'76'|rlm|safe}} is Model Master
    Enamel, but the 74 and 75 on the upper surfaces are Mr. Hobby Color. I had to
    order these from Eric YY (now {{ 'Sealmodel' | linkTo('http://www.sealmodel.com') | safe }})
    in Hong Kong, as these paints are impossible to find here
    in the US. I thinned them with Tamiya thinner, as I had heard they behaved
    much like Tamiya. They went on well, but in the future I'll probably stick
    with Tamiya, as it is much easier to obtain.
</p>
<p>
    I first tried to apply the mottle with my Grex Tritium, but it did not go on well.
    I was using the 0.5mm needle, which may have had something to do with it.
    After that fiasco, I just used a microbrush to apply the mottle.
</p>
<p>
    The cockpit was Tamiya {{'63'|txf|safe}} German Grey. The wheel wells were a custom mix of Tamiya
    {{'22'|txf|safe}} RLM Grey and {{'2'|txf|safe}} Flat White. The tires were Floquil Weathered Black.
    The {{'04'|rlm|safe}} under the cowling is Floquil Reefer Yellow.
</p>
<p>
    As with the {{ 'Academy Hellcat' | linkTo('../1101/') | safe }}, I knew I would need aftermarket decals.
    I went with the EagleCals set. They went on well using hot water (as they usually do).
    The only issue was that the insignias on the bottom of the wings were quite glossy,
    but nothing that a clear flat did not take care of.
