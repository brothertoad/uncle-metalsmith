	Although I've built several Fw 190's before, this is my first Dora. It went together
	like a typical Tamiya kit - very easily.

	There really isn't much to say about the construction. It represents Theo Nibel's aircraft
	from Operation Bodenplatte, which is one of the options included with the kit decals.
	The {{f.rlm('04')}} under the cowling and on the rudder are not shown on the kit instructions,
	but I noticed that
	{{f.linkTo('Tom Cleaver painted them that way','http://www.modelingmadness.com/review/axis/cleaver/cleaver24190d.htm')}}.
	I used Floquil Reefer Yellow for the {{f.rlm('04')}}, and Model Master Enamels for the
	{{f.rlm('76/82/83')}}. I freehanded the mottling on the fin, which is actually one of my
	better attempts. One of the reasons I chose these markings is the lack of mottling
	on the fuselage.

	The kit decals didn't really go on that well. It took quite a long dip in water
	to get them to come off. The spiral on the spinner broke, so I left it off.

	I always seem to have trouble attaching the landing gear on 190's, due to the
	activator arm. I did a better job this time - I held the arm against the strut with
	my thumb, and then used tweezers to attach the other side. I did notice that it
	helped to attach the inner end towards the surface of the wing, rather than
	against the wheel well.
