	This kit was built because I wanted to build something quick. It didn't turn out
	to be that quick, but that was because the paint job was something complex.
	This kit also made me realize that 1/72 is not my scale, and I'm in the process
	of selling most of my 1/72 stash.

	There really isn't much to say about this kit. It went together quite well - I
	don't recall any fit issues. I primed with {{'Mr. Surfacer'|nowrap|safe}} 1200. The {{'76'|rlm|safe}} on the
	bottom is Model Master enamel, as is the {{'75'|rlm|safe}} on the top. The {{'74'|rlm|safe}} is
	White Ensign enamel. The propellor blades are Floquil Brunswick Green, and I
	used Floquil Reefer Yellow for the {{'04'|rlm|safe}}. The exhaust is {{'61'|mrcolor|safe}} Burnt Iron,
	which I really didn't like. The Testor Metalizer is better.

	Knowing Academy decals, I used the decals from the Airfix A02029A kit. I didn't
	bother to apply the stencils, since they aren't noticeable at this scale.
	The spinner is supposed to have a thin black spiral, but I could not apply
	the decal with any degree of accuracy, so I left it off.
