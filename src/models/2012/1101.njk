  Here is the Academy 1/72 Focke-Wulf Fw 190A-8, kit number 2213.  The kit also
  includes the K&uuml;belwagen, but I have not built that yet.

  I built this kit to try out {{'Mr. Surfacer'|nowrap|safe}} as a primer for a camouflaged airplane.  It worked very
  well.  As it happens, the kit was missing a sprue, so I used some left-over parts from a previous
  build.  There is no cockpit, but I think everything else is there.  The drop tank was quite a bit
  too small for the bracket that holds it.

  The canopy was masked by hand.  I used Eagle Strike 72053 Focke-Wulf Fw 190.  According to the
  decal instruction sheet, this plane was flown by Kurt Petzsch as part of 7II./JG26.
  The colors are {{'75/82'|rlm|safe}} over {{'76'|rlm|safe}}.  I used {{'Mr. Color'|nowrap|safe}} for
  the 76 and 75, and Tamiya {{'26'|txf|safe}} Deep Green
  for the 82.  The yellow was Floquil Reefer Yellow, which I think is a close match for {{'04'|rlm|safe}}.
  The exhaust panels are a bit too long - they should not extend back quite as far as I made
  them.  Other than that, I thought the colors came out well.  This particular plane did not have much
  mottling, so I didn't put much on.  The work numbers on the fin came off while I was
  spraying a second gloss coat.
