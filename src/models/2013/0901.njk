	As with my previous completion, the
	{{ 'Arii Bf 109G-6' | linkTo('../0801/') | safe }},
	this is my second build of a kit, in this case the Academy {{'P-47D'|nowrap|safe}}, kit 2174.
	I was working on the HobbyBoss 1/48 {{'P-51D'|nowrap|safe}}, and was planning on using the Mr. Finishing
	Surfacer 1500 Black as a primer.  Just to be on the safe side, I decided to
	try it on a smaller kit first, and
	since I had this one in the stash, it became my guinea pig.  (As it happened, the
	P-51D ended up FUBAR anyway.)
</p>
<p>
	I was glad I did.  The Mr. Finishing Surfacer covered very well, but it was quite
	flat.  Gunze recommends it as a primer for metallic finishes, so I expected
	it to be gloss.  I actually sprayed some Tamiya {{'1'|tx|safe}} Black over it, but that didn't help
	much.
</p>
<p>
	The kit went together very well, as Academy kits do.  I used Tamiya {{'5'|txf|safe}} Flat Green
	for the cockpit.  I didn't bother to paint the walls of the cockpit.  For the exterior,
	I first painted the white area for the invasion stripes with Mr. Base White 1000.
	This goes on very smoothly.  I then masked the areas I wanted to stay white, and
	painted the rest of the airframe with the Mr. Finishing Surfacer 1500 Black.  I
	masked the black areas and proceeded to paint the NMF, using
	Auto Air Aluminum Base (Fine).  This paint really needs a gloss undercoat.  On this
	kit, the landing gear - which was primed only with Tamiya {{'1'|tx|safe}}, turned out pretty good,
	but the main airframe - which was primed with the Mr. Finishing Surfacer - turned out
	quite grainy.
</p>
<p>
	The landing gear is Tamiya {{'11'|tx|safe}} Chrome Silver, the tires are Tamiya
	{{'63'|txf|safe}} German Grey,
	the propellor blades are Tamiya {{'1'|tx|safe}} Black, and the propellor hub is Floquil Old Silver.
	The bombs are Mr. Color Olive Drab, the anti-glare panel is Model Master Enamel Olive
	Drab {{'ANA-613'|nowrap|safe}}, and the landing gear bay and doors are Tamiya {{'4'|txf|safe}} Yellow Green.
</p>
<p>
	As with most of my Academy kits, I used aftermarket decals - Superscale {{'72-886'|nowrap|safe}}.  I chose
	the Black Panther for the simple reason that it had a relatively simple scheme.  The
	decals went on very well.
</p>
<p>
	I	used the Eduard precut mask for the windshield, but masked the canopy by hand.  It is
	not hard to do with {{'P-47'|nowrap|safe}} bubbletops.
