	This is the second time I've build the Tamiya 1/72 Jack.
	As with several of my previous models, I wanted to try some new
	techniques, and I figured a cheap kit like this one would fit the bill.
	I think it cost me about $6.

<p>
	I started with Krylon White Primer, but the can clogged, so I switched
	to Duplicolor White Primer.  Both worked reasonably well, but the Krylon sprayed
	a bit better.  The underside was Floquil CN Gray #17 (F110252).  This is a
	railroad color, but matched IJN Gray rather well.  The top was Model Master
	Enamel Euro Dark Green (FS34092).  It was not as dark as I hoped, but looked
	a little better after the clear coats were on.  The anti-glare panel was
	Floquil Engine Black.  I thinned all both of these with regular paint thinner.

	The cockpit was Tamiya {{'5'|txf|safe}} Flat Green, which was too dark.  The yellow on
	the winge edge was Tamiya {{'3'|txf|safe}} Flat Yellow, which matched the yellow lightning
	bolts rather well.  The engine and fan were Tamiya {{'56'|txf|safe}} Metallic Gray, and
	the prop was {{'131'|mrcolor|safe}} Propellor Color.  The bombs were Tamiya {{'1'|txf|safe}} Flat
	Black.  The guns were Tamiya {{'10'|tx|safe}} Gun Metal, and the landing gear were {{'8'|mrcolor|safe}}
	Silver.  The tires were Polly Scale Grimy Black.  For the wheels, I used
	Liquitex Soft Body Black.
</p>
<p>
	I masked the canopy by hand, in one step.  I used a technique I ready about
	on ARC.  I put a piece of foil on the workbench, which reflected the light
	up.  That made it much easier to see the frames.  It wasn't perfect, but I
	will definitely use the same technique in the future.
</p>
<p>
	Decals are from the kit.  I used Microset under them, but I did not need
	any solvent on top.  As always, I used rather hot water, and I think that
	helps make the decal lay down better.
