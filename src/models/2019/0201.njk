    Just like last September, January was not a good month.  I got frustrated with
    several models, so I decided to put together another Meng World War Toons kit.
    This one did not go together quite as well as the {{f.linkTo('T-34','../../2018/0901/')}},
    but I did manage to finish it.
</p>
<p>
    As with the T-34, there really isn't to much to say.  The only issue I had was
    with the brackets that go around the headlights.  One of them broke, so I just
    left them off.  I use epoxy to try to fill in the mounting holes.  It didn't work
    that well - you can still see the depressions - but I didn't think I'd be able to
    sand the area due to the proximity of other parts.

    I primed the exterior with Krylon Gray Primer.  For the olive drab, I used a
    mix of 3 parts Tamiya {{f.txf('62')}} Olive Drab with 1 part {{f.txf('60')}} Dark Yellow.  I have
    run across a couple of forum posts where this mix is recommended.  I thought it
    looked quite good and will use it on my next 1/35 US tank.
</p>

    I used Future as a gloss coat prior to applying the decals, and also as a sealer
    after the decals had been applied.  The flat coat was a mixture of Future with
    Tamiya {{f.tx('21')}} Flat Base.
