<p>
    As with {{ 'my previous Meng World War Toons build' | linkTo('../0701/') | safe }},
    this build came about because I was frustrated with other builds.

<p>
    There really isn't much to say about this build, as these World War Toons
    kits are so simple.  It went together easily.  I painted the exterior with
    AMMO by Mig 008 RAL 7021 Dunkelgrau.  This was my first experience using
    AMMO paints over a reasonably large surface, and I was pleased.  I did not have
    to thin the paint at all.  It also dried glossy enough so that I did not need
    to spray a gloss coat prior to applying the decals.
