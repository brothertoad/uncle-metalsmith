<p>
    As with last month's {{f.linkTo('Sherman','../0201/')}},  I built this kit
    because the last several projects had been frustrating.  My shelf of doom is
    getting full.
</p>
<p>
    Even though this is an old kit - according to
    {{f.linkTo('Scalemates','https://www.scalemates.com/kits/tamiya-35270-sdkfz-222-leichter-panzerspaehwagen-4x4--128398')}},
    this kit was originally released in 1975 - there really isn't to much to say.
    I debated whether or not to use the photo etch.  In the end I did, although I
    did not get it to fit quite right.
</p>
<p>
    I primed the exterior with Krylon Red Primer.  I'll have to avoid using this on
    photo etch in the future - it is so thick it clogged some of the screen on top.
    The exterior is Tamiya
    {{f.txf('63')}} German Grey.  The tires were painted Tamiya {{f.txf('1')}} Flat Black.
    I usually use NATO Black for tires, but I wanted a bit more contrast with
    the rest of the exterior.
</p>
<p>
    Once again I used Future as a gloss coat prior to applying the decals, and also as a sealer
    after the decals had been applied.  The flat coat was a mixture of Future with
    Tamiya {{f.tx('21')}} Flat Base.  Unlike my other armor builds, I didn't do any
    weathering.
