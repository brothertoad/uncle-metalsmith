  This is my second build of this kit, and {{f.linkTo('the first build','../../2020/1201/')}}
  was less than a year ago.  This one even has the same paint scheme, but I used a different color.
  As a matter of fact, I built this because I wanted to try a different shade of black for the upper color.

  There isn't much to say about assembly.  I've built several of the Tamiya 1/48 P-47's, so
  at this point I know what to expect.  Once again, I primed with a mixture of artists acrylic white
  (Liquitex soft body) and Future, about one part paint to three parts Future.  I used this because
  I wanted to see if the NMF on the bottom turned out better with a glossy undercoat.  I used
  Gaia Silver {{f.nowrap('EX-07')}}, and it turned out very smooth, if a bit bright.  For the top,
  I used a mixture of Tamiya {{f.txf('1')}} Flat Black and {{f.tx('3')}} Royal Blue, in a 4:3 ratio.
  I had seen this someone online as a mix for  Mitsubishi Cowling Color, and someone said it might
  make a good choice for P-47M's.  I think it turned out well.
