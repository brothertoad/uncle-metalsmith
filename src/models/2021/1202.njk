  As I mentioned in {{f.linkTo('my last build','../1201/')}},
  my modeling mojo has been low for a while.  I've had
  a couple of the old Tamiya dinosaur kits in the stash, and I figured something like
  that might help me get out of the doldrums.  It definitely helped!
</p>
<p>
  This was one of Tamiya's first dinosaur kits, and it does not go together like
  a modern Tamiya kit.  The diorama kit of this subject has new molds.  I had to
  fill in several gaps.  I used epoxy, and that worked okay.  I wanted to
  avoid sanding, so I used a cotton swab to wipe away the excess epoxy before it set.
</p>

  Not surprisingly, there aren't any photographs of actual living dinosaurs.  The
  Triceratops reminds me of a rhinoceros (although the Triceratops was a
  reptile and the rhino is a mammal), so I went with a gray scheme.  I primed with
  Ace Hardware white primer from a rattle can.  I found that as I sprayed the top
  coats, the primer absorbed the paint, so I won't be using that again.  The belly
  was painted with Tamiya {{f.txf('19')}} Sky Grey, which was actually a bit lighter
  than I was going for.  I then sprayed the sides and the top with {{f.txf('75')}}
  IJN Gray (Kure arsenal), and the very top was painted my mix for {{f.rlm('74')}},
  which is {{f.txf('24')}} Dark Grey with some {{f.txf('27')}} Black Green.

  The horns were handpainted a mix of White and Golden Sunset, both from the Apple
  Barrel line.  I was very pleased with how it turned out - it was just the shade
  of yellowish white that I was aiming at.  The eyes were painted Jo Sonja
  Naples Yellow Hue, with Vallejo Model Color Black for the centers.
</p>
<p>
  After painting was complete, the kit was given a coat of Future, then a wash of
  Vallejo Model Color Black Grey in a bit of soapy water.  It flowed well, but didn't
  make the animal look as dirty as I'd hoped.  I then gave it a flat coat, and it was
  done.  Two nice things about dinosaurs: no decals and no canopy to mask!
