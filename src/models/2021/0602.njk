  This is the Tamiya Dewoitine D.520.  I believe it was called 520 because it reached
  a top speed of 520 kph.  The build was pretty stress-free, even as the Tamiya
  single-prop subjects go.

  I had purchased the AMMO color set for French WWII aircraft for this aircraft.
  The set contained 0208 Dark Compass Ghost Gray for the bottom, and 0228 Intermediate
  Blue, 0074 Green Moss and 0034 Rust Tracks for the top.  While I was building
  this kit, I came across
  {{f.linkTo('this build of the MB.155','https://modelingmadness.com/review/allies/cleaver/fr/tc155.htm')}}
  on Modeling Madness, where Tom Cleaver used {{f.rlm('76')}} for the bottom, and
  {{f.txf('54')}} Dark Sea Grey, {{f.txf('26')}} Deep Green and {{f.txf('9')}} Hull Red
  for the upper surfaces.  I didn't like the AMMO Green Moss - it seemed too light and too olive -
  so I followed Tom's lead and used Deep Green for the top.  The other colors are AMMO.
  The green and reddish brown on the top were freehanded with my new Tamiya airbrush,
  which worked very well.

  Although the kit came with decals for six subjects, I used Iliad Decals 48009.  The plane with
  the yellow tail caught my eye, plus I wanted a subject that did not have a long decal down
  the side.  The decals worked fine.  I used a mask from
  {{f.linkTo('Montex Masks','http://www.montex-mask.com/en/home')}}, which worked well.
  The kit comes with two antenna masts, a short one and a long one.  I broke the long one while
  sanding it, so I had to use the short one, even though the subject had the long mast.
