  This was another of the lot of bagged 109 kits I purchased some time ago.  Although
  I don't remember where I got them, I had a set of decals from the "End of War" G-10
  boxing, so I decided to use the Croatian decals from that kit.  It wasn't until after
  I started painting the kit that I realized I had done the same subject
  {{f.linkTo('back in August','../0801/')}} (although that was the
  Hobbycraft kit).  I am definitely getting old!
</p>

  The kit did not include the small wheel bulges for the wings - only the large ones,
  so those are what I used.

  Although it is the same subject as the Hobbycraft build, I found
  {{f.linkTo('this topic','https://www.britmodeller.com/forums/index.php?/topic/235081148-that-croatian-defectors-bf109g-a-colour-pic/')}}
  on {{f.linkTo('britmodeller.com','https://www.britmodeller.com/forums/')}}
  that indicated that the colors should be {{f.rlm('75')}} and {{f.rlm('83')}}
  over {{f.rlm('76')}}, so I used those colors.  The Hobbycraft build was done
  in 81 and 83.  I used a mixture of one part {{f.txf('23')}} Light Blue and
  one part {{f.txf('2')}}
  Flat White for the {{f.rlm('76')}},
  {{f.txf('54')}} Dark Sea Grey for the {{f.rlm('75')}} and {{f.txf('13')}}
  JA Green for the {{f.rlm('83')}}.
</p>
<p>
  As mentioned above, the decals came from
  {{f.linkTo('the "End Of War" boxing','https://www.scalemates.com/kits/hasegawa-09742-messerschmitt-bf109g-10-end-war--101090')}}.
  The decals may have been included in the box of 109's I purchased.  They took a
  long time to come off the backing paper - literally three or four minutes.  As a
  consequence, they were a bit hard to move once they were on the model.  That being said,
  they adhered quite well.
