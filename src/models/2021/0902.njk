  This is the Hasegawa A6M3 kit, in the Magnificent Kotobuki boxing.  I believe The
  Magnificent Kotobuki is an anime.  I've picked up a number of these anime/manga
  kits, as I like doing unusual markings.  However, as the photos show, this one is
  in conventional markings.  I had those markings left over from
  {{f.linkTo('the old tool Tamiya A6M3','../../2020/0101/')}},
  and decided to save the Kotobuki markings to use on
  {{f.linkTo('the new tool Tamiya A6M3','https://www.scalemates.com/kits/tamiya-61108-mitsubishi-a6m3-3a-zero-fighter-zeke--121431')}}.

  As with {{f.linkTo('the A6M5','../0603/')}}, the build went together well.
  I used Tamiya {{f.txf('12')}} JN Grey for the overall color.  Interestingly, the
  instructions for the new tool kit say to use {{f.txf('76')}} Gray Green (IJN),
  wshich I think is a bit lighter.  The mottling is {{f.txf('11')}} JN Green.

  As mentioned above, the markings came from the Tamiya kit.  The hinomarus came
  from Techmod 48038.  All the decals went on well with Microscale solutions.

  I didn't realize until after I had taken the photos and was writing this up that
  I forgot to attach the wingtip lights.  I'll have to do that before this one goes
  on the shelf.
