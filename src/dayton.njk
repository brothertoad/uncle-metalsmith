    This page contains a set of mixes using Tamiya paint.  It was originally posted on
    {{ 'the IPMS Dayton web site' | linkTo('https://www.ipmsdayton.com/') | safe }} at
    http://www.ipmsdayton.com/sites/default/files/Tamiya_Mixes.txt,
    but as of this writing (January 2022) you get a Forbidden message if you go there.
    I found a copy on
    {{ "Old Sarge's blog" | linkTo('https://oldsargesaircraft.blogspot.com/2019/12/ipms-dayton-tamiya-mixes.html') | safe }}.
    I decided to post the contents here.  I have fixed a few typos, cleaned up the formatting
    a bit and also made the FS numbers into actual links.

    Unfortunately, I do not know who the originator of this page was or why it is no longer
    accessible from the IPMS Dayton site.  If anyone has any information about this, or if
    the owner of this info does not wish me to duplicate it here, please contact me at
